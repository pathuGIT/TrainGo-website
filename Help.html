                    <p>In Sri Lanka, the train services offer three classes of travel :</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>First Class:</b> First-class seats are the most expensive and offer the most
                            comfortable and spacious seating with air conditioning. This class is available
                            on selected trains such as the Rajadhani Express, Udarata Menike, and Podi Menike.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            <b>Second Class:</b> Second-class seats are more affordable than first class and offer
                            comfortable seating with fans. This class is available on all trains and is the
                            most popular option for most passengers.
                        </li><br>
                        <li>
                            <b>Third Class:</b> Third-class seats are the cheapest option available and offer basic
                            seating with no fans. This class is available on all trains and is often crowded,
                            especially during peak travel times.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It's worth noting that some trains may have different classes or seating arrangements,
                        depending on the route and train type. It's always a good idea to check with the train
                        service provider or online booking portal for specific details on the classes available
                        for your chosen journey.</p>

                            especially during peak travel seasons. Train schedules may change from time to time,
                            so it is also recommended to confirm your travel plans with the train operator or travel

                            be aware of the platform number and the direction of the train.
